# Traditional-Searching-Algorithms-Visualizer
 A java desktop application built using the Swing library. It serves as a visual educational tool for the field of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on traditional searching algorithms, including Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth   First Search (DFS), Best First Search, and A* algorithm, the core functionality of the application is the visualization of the selected search algorithm. When the "visualize" button is pressed, the program animates the algorithm's execution    on the grid, using different colors to highlight the current node, frontier nodes, and the path to the goal.
